<p class="fw-bold">Evaluation Index</p>
        Our team of experts is currently working on the development of a novel methodology based on elements of the EU’s own membership criteria to analyze and assess how Ukraine is getting through with reforms and transformations on the way to full-fledged EU membership.
Soon on this page you will find details of methodology, Evaluation Index implementation history and case studies, actual ratings and progress reports, expert opinions on the reliability of the instrument as well as simplicity of its usage.

<p class="fw-bold">Mission</p>
«ERGOSUM» – European Research Group Of Support for Ukrainian Membership.
The fact that Ukraine is edging closer to the EU, means that the conceptual and policy ‘goalposts’ regarding EU-Ukraine relations are evolving. This emerging situation has revealed an acute need for informed research, fresh knowledge, and expert capacity on European integration to support Ukraine on its way to European Union.
There is tremendous political will across Europe in support of Ukraine’s «European perspective», and since it has been an Associated state since 2014, the country has already become aligned with much of the EU’s body of laws and other norms. However, joining the EU is a meticulous process, involving massive bureaucratic effort, and technical transformation, with the onus on the candidate to prove their readiness and capacity to be a member against the conditions set by the EU. Evidence also shows that Ukraine has been a persistently bad performer in fundamental areas to do with the rule of law, democracy and good governance – which are key parts of the Copenhagen Criteria, and probably the most fundamental and expressions of EU values.
«ERGOSUM» project aims to help solve problems and overcome potential obstacles that will arise in such areas as the rule of law, governance and economy, democracy and governance, and may hinder the Europeanization of the country. And also to prevent a rollback of Ukraine's legal-administrative and institutional capacities to assume the obligations of the EU. Thanks to its activities, the project will also expand expert capabilities, which will become an important basis for Ukraine's transition from candidate status to full membership, and will provide professional support along the way.
<br><br>

<p class="fw-bold">Vision</p>
ERGOSUM project aims to create new research terrain on contemporary EU-Ukraine relations, embedded within a framework of enlargement studies and Europeanisation and based on intensive collaboration between European and Ukrainian scientists. In so doing, the project aims to raise the quality of joint Euro-Ukrainian research on topics of mutual interest, via joint publications and other collaborative activities for the academic communities, civil society and other stakeholders.
To succeed the project will also aim to create stakeholder network (Platform of Expertize), that bring together academics, experts, policy makers, young leaders and civil society from Ukraine and EU.
The project also aims to develop a novel methodology, using elements of the EU’s own membership criteria to analyze and assess how Ukraine get through with reforms and transformations on the way to full-fledged EU membership (Evaluation Index).
A wide expert network of scientists, politicians, representatives of civil society from Ukraine and the countries of the European Union will be involved in the development of the Index criteria and mechanism of usage. The creation of such network is indicated in goal number 1.
