«ERGOSUM» – European Research Group Of Support for Ukrainian Membership.
The fact that Ukraine is edging closer to the EU, means that the conceptual and policy ‘goalposts’ regarding EU-Ukraine relations are evolving. This emerging situation has revealed an acute need for informed research, fresh knowledge, and expert capacity on European integration to support Ukraine on its way to European Union.
There is tremendous political will across Europe in support of Ukraine’s «European perspective», and since it has been an Associated state since 2014, the country has already become aligned with much of the EU’s body of laws and other norms. However, joining the EU is a meticulous process, involving massive bureaucratic effort, and technical transformation, with the onus on the candidate to prove their readiness and capacity to be a member against the conditions set by the EU. Evidence also shows that Ukraine has been a persistently bad performer in fundamental areas to do with the rule of law, democracy and good governance – which are key parts of the Copenhagen Criteria, and probably the most fundamental and expressions of EU values.
«ERGOSUM» project aims to help solve problems and overcome potential obstacles that will arise in such areas as the rule of law, governance and economy, democracy and governance, and may hinder the Europeanization of the country. And also to prevent a rollback of Ukraine's legal-administrative and institutional capacities to assume the obligations of the EU. Thanks to its activities, the project will also expand expert capabilities, which will become an important basis for Ukraine's transition from candidate status to full membership, and will provide professional support along the way.
